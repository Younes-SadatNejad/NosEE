# Abstract
Detection of the number of source signals (NoSS) in
the presence of additive noise is considered. We present a new approach
denoted by themean squared eigenvalue error (MSEE).The
MSEE is the mean squared error between the desired noise-free
eigenvalues and the available estimated eigenvalues. The approach
investigates and analyzes the probabilistic distribution of the available
eigenvalue estimates and revisits proper thresholding of these
sorted values. The optimum NoSS is provided by minimizing the
MSEE. A probabilistic worst-case technique is proposed to estimate
the value of the MSEE by using only the available data. It is
shown that the proposed method is consistent as the data length
increases. It is also shown that the method is consistent as the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases. Simulation results illustrate
advantages of the MSEE over competing approaches and confirm
effectiveness and robustness of theMSEE even in low-SNR or small
sample size scenarios.
